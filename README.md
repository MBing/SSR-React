# Server Side Rendered React

This repo has a small application to demonstrate the use of SSR with React. The main challenges are Routing and State, I used:
- [react-router-config](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-config)
- [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)

## Setup

```
  $ yarn dev # inside the `server` folder
```
